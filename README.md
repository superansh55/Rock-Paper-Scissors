This is a browser console game made with javascript

To play this game you simply need to click on the respective choice buttons and you will able to see the scores in realtime along with winner/loser of each round and an alert after 5 rounds declaring the final winner and resetting the game.

This project helpmed me solidify my understanding about topics like:

functions

debugging

logic

dom manipulation

i also got to learn about branching and merging in git since this project was initially console based and the updation to DOM was done in a seperate feature branch.
